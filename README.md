# AOIGroups
Scripts for calculating statistical data for word-aoi-groups
Heidelberg University Language and Cognition Lab - https://hulclab.eu

## About

These scripts were created to facilitate analysis of multi-word AOI groups in linguistic eyetracking data.
SMI beGaze automatically generates AOIs around each word of a text stimulus. Our researchers needed a tool to perform multiple pass analysis, regression analysis etc. for variable groupings of these AOIs. Later a variant of the script that works with exported data from Tobii Studio was added.

## Installing

You can simply download the executables in the [dist](dist) directory, which were generated using pyinstaller on a windows system running Python 3.7.
If you want to run the scripts on other systems or if you need to modify the scripts for your own purposes, download the sources. They should run on a standard [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.7 installation.

## Usage

The two scripts are meant to be used as command-line tools.
